# Sudoku-Go

This is a Sudoku Website connected with Golang which solves, checks, and generates different boards

1) To use make sure you have Go installed, then you must install the package 
2) go get github.com/googollee/go-socket.io, then just type 
3) go run main.go generator.go solver.go, and finally go to 127.0.0.1:8000

### Examples

When the website loads it looks like this:

When you solve the sudoku, check, and it works:
![alt text][solved]

When you check, and it detects and error:
![alt text][error]

I would like any feedback on this, and to optimize anything!
