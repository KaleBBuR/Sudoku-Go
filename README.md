# Sudoku-Go

This is a Sudoku Website connected with Golang which solves, checks, and generates different boards

### To use make sure you have Go installed, then you must install the package
### **go get github.com/googollee/go-socket.io**, then just type
### **go run main.go generator.go solver.go**, and finally
### go to **127.0.0.1:8000**

I would like any feedback on this, and to optimize anything!
